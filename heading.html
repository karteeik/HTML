        Bhagwan Shiv, or Shiva, is a Hindu deity who plays many roles, including the creator, protector, and transformer of the universe. He is also known as the great ascetic, the master of fertility, poison, and medicine, and the Lord of Cattle. In the Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is considered Shiva's equal complementary partner
Shiva is part of the Hindu trinity,<br><br> the Trimurti, along with Brahma and Vishnu. In the Smarta tradition, &nbsp; &nbsp; Shiva is one of five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja. <hr> Some say that Shiva's father is Lord Brahma and his mother is Goddess Parvati, also known as Shakti or Devi. According to legend, Parvati also plays the role of Shiva's consort

        <p>it is pre tage text like poem</p>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.
        When the blazing sun is gone,
        When henothing shines upon,
        Then you show your little light,
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
